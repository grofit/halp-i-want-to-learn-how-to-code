# Tooling

## Tools To Use

So far everything has been theoretical and just you reading stuff, now we want to actually start running code and given we are trying to express the core concepts in a language agnostic way its difficult to have a tool that covers all languages/use cases.

> In most real world applications of programming you will be working with a single IDE (Integrated Development Environment) per language, such as Visual Studio.

For simplicity we will stick to web based tools, the reasoning for this is:

- You dont need to install anything locally
- You just click a link and off you go
- You can save and share your produced code
- We can provide example links for you to run

As mentioned before, this is ONLY because you are learning the basics of coding, if you were doing this for a job you would also need to learn about each tool a bit more in depth, but we can touch on that later.

Anyway for the moment we will be using [Sololearns Code Editor](https://code.sololearn.com/) as it supports lots of languages and is easy enough to use and has basic `intellisense`. 

> Intellisense is basically a fancy term for intelligence auto complete for code, much like on your phone you can type "hel" and it will often suggest "hello", "hell", "helicopter" etc to you.
