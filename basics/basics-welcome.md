# Congrats For Getting This Far

Well done on getting this far! programming can be fairly boring to begin with, and it can be a lot to take in, but we have covered the building blocks for almost all programming you could ever do at this point, and hopefully you will agree that none of it has been too scary.

> Almost all programming at its heart is just running logic (functions) with data (variables), which is the bulk of what we have covered so far, but most real use cases will be building upon these fundamental layers.

In the next few sections we will be a bit more practical in terms of writing code and seeing how actual applications are put together and how to do things with functions and variables.
