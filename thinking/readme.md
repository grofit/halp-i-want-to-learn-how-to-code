# Thinking about stuff

This section is less about **DOING** and more about learning about the basics of code and the commonality most programming languages share.

You wont be needing do anything practical here, just read over and attempt to understand whats going on.

For the most part code examples will be succinct and will be explained, there will be a few examples showing different languages side by side, which may seem scary at first, but as we are not trying to teach **one language** but teach the **fundamentals of programming** it should actually make things easier in the long run.

Once we have discussed at a high(ish) level the basic bits of code we can then dive into writing some code and seeing what happens.
