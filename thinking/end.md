# End of thinking (for now)

We have covered a lot of ground here, and not just in a single language but in multiple ones.

As I have said before I think its better that you try to think outside of how individual languages express things and just think of the concepts at a high level.

So we have seen how to:

- Create and assign variables
- Use operators to compare/evaluate values (or variables)
- Write functions and use them

While there is quite a bit more to cover I think at this point we can jump into actually writing some code and seeing what happens on the fly.

Rather than make you download a load of tools we will just use publicly availabe tools online that let you put in some code (in varying languages) and see the results.
