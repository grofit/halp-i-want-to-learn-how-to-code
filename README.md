# HALP! I want to learn how to code

> It is recommended you read this book via the [gitbook viewer](https://grofit.gitbook.io/halp-i-want-to-learn-how-to-code), however you can read it all on github directly if you want.

## A bit about what we will cover
We will start off super simple and build up across multiple programming languages so you at least know how to do basic programming. It may seem super daunting if you have never programmed before but its actually pretty simple, and you dont need any crazy physics or math knowledge which was always told to me when I was learning to code, as long as you can read and can think you will be fine.

I started writing an ebook/thing like this a while ago but for programmers who were already pretty decent and wanted to expand their horizons more into design patterns and other approaches, and while doing that I was reminded of tutorials I used to write way back when and that it may be a good idea to try and summarise it all.

## What you will learn
- How to write code, and have the computer do stuff with your code

## What you will not learn
- How to hack into a bank
- How to fix a printer
- How to enter the matrix
- How to restore a broken computer because a relative did something silly with it, but they will say they didnt

## Expected reader skill level
This ebook/course/thing is for anyone.

If you know how to turn a computer on and can type you are already well prepared. It helps if you know how to google and use command line stuffs. For the first few chapters you wont even need to write anything, just read and think a bit.
